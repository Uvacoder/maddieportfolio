            h1 Hi, I'm Maddie.

            p I'm an inclusive design leader with over 15 years of industry experience. I provide users with meaningful product experiences by advocating for their needs through user-centered design methods. I am deeply committed to collaboration and love working with cross-functional teams. A great day for me is when I'm learning and working alongside my teammates.

            p I currently reside in beautiful Colorado with my wife and our dogs, Norah and Rosie, and our cat, Henry.
