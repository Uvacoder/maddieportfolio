            h1 Hi, I'm Kate.

            p I specialize in product design, user experience and user interface design,  and front-end development. I am extremely passionate about people and as a designer I love that I am able to be an advocate for users. I whole heartedly believe that design can and should be used as a force for good.

            p I currently reside in beautiful Colorado with my wife and  our dogs, Norah and Rosie, and our cat, Henry.
