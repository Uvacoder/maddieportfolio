      p Balancing Act is an online experience to engage citizens in public budgeting. For two years, I lead a team of one project manager, two developers, and one strategist and was the Lead Designer and Strategist. I lead the product design, front end development, rebranding, and creation of a supplemental product called <a href="http://abalancingact.com/solutions/tax-receipt" target="_blank">Taxpayer Receipt</a>.
