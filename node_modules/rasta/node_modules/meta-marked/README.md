## meta-marked
#### The [marked](http://github.com/chjj/marked) markdown processor for Node.js with support for [YAML](http://yaml.org/) metadata

Just a quick extension I needed for processing markdown in Node. Props to Christopher Jeffrey for his excellent markdown processor 'marked'.

The `meta-marked` function behaves exactly the same as [`marked`](http://github.com/chjj/marked#usage), except for the following:

- Instead of returning a parsed string, `meta-marked` returns an object with two properties: `meta`, which contains the metadata object or `null` if metadata isn't found, and `html`, which contains the parsed HTML.
- `metaMarked.noMeta` is a reference to the `marked` function, so it can be used to avoid parsing metadata.

In order to include metadata in a document, insert YAML at the top of the document surrounded by `---` and `...`. Note that if the given string doesn't start with `---`, it will not be interpreted as having metadata.

### Example

```
---
Title:   My awesome markdown file
Author:  Me
Scripts:
    - js/doStuff.js
    - js/doMoreStuff.js
...

##Header
Regular text and stuff goes here.
```

will result in the following output:

```
{
	"meta": {
		"Title": "My awesome markdown file",
		"Author": "Me",
		"Scripts": [
			"js/doStuff.js",
			"js/doMoreStuff.js"
		]
	},
	"html": "<h2>Header</h2>\n<p>Regular text and stuff goes here.</p>\n"
}
```
