I’ve found that use of rapid prototyping followed by user testing allows for informed data and lots of iteration.</p><p>Below are an example of a two year project, a two week project, and a project that was about 25% completed when given to me. In showing all three, I’m hoping to exemplify how my design process* can be applied to long, short, and partially completed project cycles effectively.</p><small>* I want to note that while these processes have been successful in the past, I do not believe following a formula is <em>always</em> the way to achieve success with a product. I like to think of these principles as a loose field guide rather than a strict set of rules. I love that design is constantly evolving and requires me to challenge my preconceived ideas and methods. Ask me the same question again in six months and I might have a different answer!</small><figure><img src="/assets/images/kf-launch-week.jpg" alt="device testing"><figcaption class="center"> <small>That's me with <em>all the devices</em> during a launch week in 2106.</small></figcaption></figure><hr class="teal"><section class="balancing-act"><h2 class="project-title"><a href="http://abalancingact.com" target="_blank">Balancing Act</a></h2><figure><img src="/assets/images/feature-ba.jpg" alt="balancing act feature"><figcaption class="center"> <small>Image courtesy of Balancing Act.</small></figcaption></figure><h3>How might we provide an interactive simulation for citizens to engage in public budgeting in order to increase transparency and demystify the budget process?</h3><h4>My role: product design, user experience, user interface, front end development</h4><h4>Biggest challenge: complex user experience</h4><p>Balancing Act is an online experience to engage citizens in public budgeting. For two years, I lead a team of one project manager, two developers, and one strategist and was the Lead Designer and Strategist. I lead the product design, user experience and user interface design, front end development, rebranding, and creation of a supplemental product called <a href="http://abalancingact.com/solutions/tax-receipt" target="_blank">Taxpayer Receipt</a>.</p><p>The biggets design challenge for this product was how to take a complex activity, the budgeting process, and make it accessible for  users without losing any of its complexity. We also wanted to decrease the amount of onboarding time that was being spent by product owners and make it easy to launch a budget. Prior to rebranding as Balancing Act, the product was called Backseat Budgeter. The sales effort for Backseat Budgeter was 20-30 hours with on-site training needed. Once Balancing Act launched, customers were able to sign up and have their budgets ready within a couple hours while eliminating the need to speak with a sales representative.</p><p>Balancing Act has been used by over 50 cities including Denver, Fort Collins, Boulder, Nashville, and San Antonio. It has been <a href="http://abalancingact.com/press" target="_blank">featured</a> on sites like <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3047270/this-app-lets-you-see-the-tough-choices-needed-to-balance-your-citys-budget" target="_blank">Fast Company</a>, <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-schooler/its-your-money-wheres-you_b_9114234.html?utm_hp_ref=politics&ir=Politics" target="_blank">HuffPost</a>, and <a href="http://www.cpr.org/news/story/washington-cant-balance-federal-budget-can-you" target="_blank">Colorado Public Radio</a>.

I played the role of Lead Designer and Front-End Developer for the marketing website that included a standalone documentation resource.</p><p>I had a two week window to produce a marketing site and documentation site. For the marketing site, I was able to implement a fun and informative design that showcased the playful side of the brand and accessible content for developers and non-developers alike. </p><p>We also needed to solve the problem of cutting down the time our engineers were spending on support requests. The long-term plan was to launch a documentation site, but there was concern about being able to get something completed within the time frame which not only worked well, but also reflected our brand. The solution I came up with for the documentation was to use a JavaScript site generator called <a href="https://docsify.js.org" target="_blank">docsify</a>. This allowed me to implement a documentation system that could easily be updated and required no back-end development. I was then able to add custom styles to match the SimpleWebRTC brand.</p><div class="button-wrap"><button><a href="http://simplewebrtc.com" target="_blank">View Site</a></button></div><hr class="light-blue"></section><section class="open-ideo"><h2 class="project-title"><a href="https://beta.openideo.com/chapters"  target="_blank">OpenIdeo</a></h2><figure><img src="/assets/images/feature-openideo.jpg" alt="open ideo feature"><figcaption class="center"> <small>Image courtesy of OpenIdeo.</small></figcaption></figure><h3>How might we take the existing prototype work for the OpenIdeo platform and turn it into a fully responsive, global social network?</h3><h4>My role: product design, user experience, user interface, responsive web, front end development</h4><h4>Biggest challenge: retrofitting for responsive design</h4><p>Ideo came to my team with wireframes and a partial design system that had been produced for the OpenIdeo platform.
